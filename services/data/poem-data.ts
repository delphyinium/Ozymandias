    title: 'Impermanence of Power',
    description: 'The poem illustrates how even the most powerful figures and empires inevitably fall to the passage of time. Ozymandias, "King of Kings," is now merely a shattered statue in the desert.',
    analysis: 'Shelley uses the crumbling statue as a powerful metaphor for the temporary nature of political power and human achievement. The once-mighty ruler who commanded fear and respect is reduced to fragments in the sand, showing that time conquers all human endeavors.'

    title: 'Art and Legacy',
    description: 'The poem explores the ironic relationship between the artist and the subject - while Ozymandias\'s empire has crumbled, the sculptor\'s representation of his "passions" has survived, albeit in ruins.',
    analysis: 'There\'s a complex interplay between artistic creation and the subject it immortalizes. The sculptor was able to capture Ozymandias\'s arrogance ("sneer of cold command"), and this artistic expression has outlived the actual empire. Art becomes a more enduring legacy than political power.'

    id: 'hubris',
    title: 'Human Hubris',
    description: 'Ozymandias represents the arrogance of those who believe their power and achievements will last forever. His command to "Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!" becomes tragically ironic.',
    analysis: 'The poem serves as a cautionary tale about human pride and the folly of believing our accomplishments are eternal. Shelley subtly invites readers to reflect on the temporary nature of all human endeavors and the inevitability of decline.'

    id: 'nature-time',
    title: 'Nature and Time',
    description: 'The "lone and level sands" that stretch "far away" emphasize how nature and time ultimately reclaim all human constructions.',
    analysis: 'Shelley contrasts human ambition against the vast, enduring power of nature. The desert setting symbolizes both time\'s erasure of human achievement and the insignificance of mankind\'s greatest works when measured against the scope of natural forces.'

    examples: ['The poem\'s volta or turn comes with "Nothing beside remains"', 'The concluding couplet provides a powerful visual of endless desert']
